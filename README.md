<h1><b>Store Application for managing products</b></h1>

<p>This full-stack application, built with Spring Boot (backend), Angular (frontend), and MySQL database, provides complete CRUD functionality for product management. 
  It allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete products through an intuitive interface with robust API support.</p>

<p>To run the application, both components must be launched: start the Spring Boot backend server first, then launch the Angular frontend. 
  The backend provides the REST API on port 8080 (default), while the frontend runs on port 4200 and connects to these API endpoints.</p>

<p>On startup, the application automatically loads at http://localhost:4200/products, displaying all database products in a list view. 
  Each product entry shows an image, name, price, and action buttons (Details, Edit, Delete). Additional product information is available in the detail view but hidden from the list for clarity.</p>
